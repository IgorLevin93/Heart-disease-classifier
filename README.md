# Heart-disease-classifier

![Preview](./cover.png)

This repository was created as part of a machine learning and Data Science course project in medicine. The task involved data analysis, preprocessing, and training of three classification models:

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* Fully Connected Neural Network

Each model's performance was evaluated using standard classification metrics. The goal was to compare these approaches and identify the most suitable one for heart disease prediction.

The project is based on the article *“An artificial intelligence model for heart disease detection using machine learning algorithms”* ([https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772442522000016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772442522000016)), which details the development and evaluation of machine learning algorithms for heart disease diagnosis. The article covers data cleaning, normalization, and algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting.

The authors demonstrate that these models achieve high accuracy (around 89–90%), making them potentially useful for integration into clinical decision support systems.

This repository replicates and extends the main ideas from the article by implementing and comparing three models on available medical data to reinforce practical skills and understanding of machine learning applications in medicine.
